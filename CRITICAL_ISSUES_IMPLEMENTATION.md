# Critical Issues Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of four critical issues for the SubStream Protocol Backend:

## Issues Implemented

### #155 Live Substream Analytics Feed (MRR/Churn Ticker)

**Description**: Real-time MRR and churn analytics pushed via WebSockets with throttling and delta calculations.

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `src/services/mrrAnalyticsService.js` - Core MRR calculation engine
- `src/websocket/websocket.gateway.ts` - Updated with MRR event handling
- `tests/mrrAnalyticsService.test.js` - Comprehensive integration tests

**Key Features**:
- **5-second throttling**: Prevents server overload during rapid transactions
- **Metric Delta calculations**: Shows previous vs current values for animations
- **Granular breakdowns**: MRR gained/lost today, churn rate, plan breakdowns
- **Redis caching**: Ensures REST API consistency with WebSocket data
- **Comprehensive testing**: Validates rapid burst handling and data consistency

**Acceptance Criteria Met**:
✅ Dashboard analytics update autonomously without user interaction  
✅ Backend throttling protects from micro-transaction calculations  
✅ Live feed perfectly mirrors authoritative database data

### #158 Row-Level Security (RLS) for Postgres Multi-Tenancy

**Description**: Database-level data isolation ensuring merchants cannot access each other's data.

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `migrations/knex/012_implement_rls_multi_tenancy.js` - Database schema migration
- `src/services/rlsService.js` - RLS context management service
- `middleware/tenantRls.js` - Express middleware for tenant context
- `tests/rlsSecurity.test.js` - Security integration tests

**Key Features**:
- **Database kernel protection**: RLS policies enforce isolation at PostgreSQL level
- **Automatic tenant context**: `SET LOCAL app.current_tenant_id` injection
- **Background worker bypass**: Special role for global operations
- **Performance optimized**: Indexes and prepared statements for <100ms queries
- **SOC2 compliant**: Structural data separation for enterprise requirements

**Acceptance Criteria Met**:
✅ Cross-tenant data leakage structurally impossible at database level  
✅ Developers don't rely solely on application-layer security  
✅ Background processes can operate across all tenants securely

### #163 Tenant-Level Storage Quotas and Archival Policies

**Description**: Storage quota enforcement and automated archival to S3 Glacier for data retention.

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `src/services/storageQuotaService.js` - Quota management and enforcement
- `src/services/archivalService.js` - Automated archival worker
- `migrations/knex/013_add_storage_quotas_and_archival.js` - Database schema
- `tests/storageQuotaArchival.test.js` - Comprehensive tests

**Key Features**:
- **Tier-based quotas**: Free (10K users), Pro (100K users), Enterprise (unlimited)
- **Real-time enforcement**: Middleware blocks quota-exceeding operations
- **Automated archival**: Moves stale data to S3 Glacier based on retention policies
- **Cached counters**: Redis-based usage tracking for minimal latency
- **Billing integration**: Logs archival operations for cost allocation

**Acceptance Criteria Met**:
✅ Strict quotas prevent resource starvation and cost overruns  
✅ Automated archival safely moves stale data without manual intervention  
✅ Quota checks execute with minimal latency using cached counters

---

### #159 Tenant-Specific API Key Scoping and Management

**Description**: Secure API key system with granular permissions for server-to-server integrations.

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `src/services/apiKeyService.js` - API key generation and management
- `middleware/apiKeyAuth.js` - Authentication and authorization middleware
- `migrations/knex/014_add_api_keys_and_audit.js` - Database schema
- `tests/apiKeyService.test.js` - Security and functionality tests

**Key Features**:
- **Cryptographically secure keys**: `sk_` prefix with 64-character hex payload
- **bcrypt hashing**: Never stores plain-text API keys
- **Granular permissions**: 12 specific permissions plus admin:all
- **Audit logging**: Complete security trail for all key operations
- **Rate limiting**: Redis-based per-key rate limiting
- **Auto-expiration**: 1-year default with manual rotation support

**Acceptance Criteria Met**:
✅ Merchants can generate secure, hashed API keys for backend systems  
✅ API keys inherit multi-tenant isolation boundaries  
✅ Granular permissions ensure principle of least privilege

## Database Migrations

Run migrations in order:

```bash
# Run all new migrations
npm run migrate

# Or run individually
npm run migrate:up 012_implement_rls_multi_tenancy
npm run migrate:up 013_add_storage_quotas_and_archival
npm run migrate:up 014_add_api_keys_and_audit
```

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Tenant Security Stack
```
Request → API Key Auth → Tenant RLS → Row-Level Security → Database
         ↓                ↓                    ↓
    JWT/Key Validation → Tenant Context → PostgreSQL RLS Policies
```

### Real-Time Analytics Flow
```
Payment Event → Redis Pub/Sub → MRR Service → Throttled Calc → WebSocket
                     ↓                                      ↓
               Event Queue                              Merchant Dashboard
```

### Storage Management Pipeline
```
Data Creation → Quota Check → Database Storage → Usage Update → Cache
                                            ↓
                                    Archival Worker → S3 Glacier → Audit Log
```

## Security Considerations

### Row-Level Security
- All sensitive tables have `tenant_id` columns
- RLS policies automatically filter by `current_setting('app.current_tenant_id')`
- Background workers use `bypass_rls` role for global operations
- Comprehensive security tests validate isolation

### API Key Security
- Keys are bcrypt-hashed with 12-round work factor
- Only shown once during creation
- Automatic expiration and revocation support
- Full audit trail for compliance

### Data Protection
- Quotas prevent resource exhaustion attacks
- Automated archival maintains performance while preserving data
- SOC2-compliant data separation
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

## Performance Optimizations

### Database
- Partial indexes for RLS-optimized queries
- Prepared statements for common operations
- Connection pooling with proper resource management

### Caching
- Redis-based MRR caching (5-minute TTL)
- Usage statistics caching (5-minute TTL)
- API key validation caching (5-minute TTL for success, 1-minute for failure)

### Real-Time Features
- 5-second throttling window for MRR calculations
- Batch processing for archival operations
- WebSocket room-based broadcasting

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Tests
- **RLS Security Tests**: Validate cross-tenant data isolation
- **MRR Analytics Tests**: Verify throttling and data consistency
- **Storage Quota Tests**: Test enforcement and edge cases
- **API Key Tests**: Security, permissions, and error handling

### Performance Tests
- RLS query performance with millions of rows
- MRR calculation under rapid transaction bursts
- Quota check latency with cached counters
- API key validation throughput

### Security Tests
- Cross-tenant data leakage prevention
- API key permission boundary testing
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Audit trail completeness

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics to Track
- API key usage patterns and failures
- MRR calculation frequency and performance
- Quota enforcement actions
- Archival operation success rates
- RLS query performance

### Audit Logs
- All API key operations (create, revoke, use)
- MRR calculation triggers and results
- Quota enforcement actions
- Data archival operations
- Security events and violations
